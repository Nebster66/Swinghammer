# Swinghammer

Swinghammer is a 2D, physics-based hobby and job simulation game built in Godot 4.4. Developed as a solo project, Swinghammer aims to showcase innovative mechanics and handcrafted pixel art, even though it is still very much a work-in-progress.

## Overview

In Swinghammer, you take on the role of a blacksmith in a whimsical setting where the core mechanic is using a cursor-controlled hammer to interact with various environmental tools, such as the forge bellows. The game focuses on realistic physics and detailed visual feedback—from weighty objects reacting naturally to each strike, to dynamic particle effects that complement the pixel art style.

> **Note:** This project is currently in its prototype/demo stage. While the core hammering mechanic is complete, the full gameplay loop—including forging, upgrading, and progression—is still under development.

## Features

- **Custom 2D Classes:**  
  Includes a custom `SwingObject2D` class (extending Godot's `RigidBody2D`) that enables dynamic object interactions and realistic physics.

- **Main Menu:**  
  A functional main menu that gives the project the façade of a complete game.

- **Handcrafted Pixel Art:**  
  All sprite art (except for the background) is uniquely crafted using Aseprite, capturing the game's distinct aesthetic.

- **Dynamic Particle Effects:**  
  Enhanced, pixelated particle effects add texture and density—especially to elements like smoke.

- **Responsive Audio Feedback:**  
  Sound effects provide satisfying audio cues to complement the visual interactions.

- **Prototype Gameplay Mechanic:**  
  A demo that showcases the main mechanic of using the hammer to interact with in-game tools.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

	```
	git clone <repository_url>
	```

2. **Open the project in Godot 4:**

	- Launch Godot 4.
	- Select "Import" and navigate to the cloned repository.
	- Open the project.

## Running the Project

After opening the project in Godot, press the play button to run the game. The main menu will appear, allowing you to access the demo scene that showcases the core hammering mechanic.

## Future Roadmap

- **Expanded Gameplay:**  
  Integration of a full gameplay loop, including forging swords, completing tasks, and upgrading tools.

- **Enhanced Interactivity:**  
  Development of additional tools and environmental interactions.

- **Polishing Visuals and Audio:**  
  Continued refinement of pixel art, particle effects, and sound feedback.

- **UI Enhancements:**  
  Further improvements to the user interface for a better overall experience.
